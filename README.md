# README

This is a minimalist documentation site generator written in Go.

This is currently a work in progress project.

# TODO

- Image Optimization for the static generated websites
- Better Image Rendering / Parsing from markdown, somehow making it pick up from me specifying the local directory so I can preview it in typora then that automatically translating in the img folder in site later on
- Table of contents appears better, formatted to appear always at the side of every single page
- Search feature
- syntax highlighting with copy button
